    <p>ようこそ、私の世界へ。
    </p>
<p>今、あなたはどんな世界を見ていますか？</p>

    <li>STRANGER</li>
         
         <p>"STRANGER" was published on August 7, 2018, at my age of 15. </p>
         <p>I named the man "STRANGER" who suddenly began to appear in my dreams every single day.</p>

   <li>NOZOKU</li>
    
   
  <p>I drew it on the black board</p>
  <p>and expresses that we can't escape from someone's sight.</p>

    <li>OZONE HOLE</li>

<li>PSYCHE</li>
<p>Rainbow braces, two tongues, bloodshot eyes that suggest sleep deprivation,</p>
<p>and all sorts of things pouring out of her head prove that this is a representation of who I am.</p>

<li>PSYENCE</li>

<p>It was inspired by the term "psyence" produced by Hideto Matsumoto  </p>
<p>which means the fusion of psycho and science.</p>
<p>As you can see, his arms and legs are made of machines, </p>
<p>his heart has been gouged out, and he is forced to smile at the seams.</p>
<p> In other words, technology, which is supposed to create happiness, can also destroy it.</p>
